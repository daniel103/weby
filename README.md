# Anastasiya Ganeeva

We've developed a website for Anastasiya Ganeeva's nail salon, aimed at assisting both her existing customers and newcomers in discovering her services. This project serves as a conclusion to our portfolio at Weby Creator Team, and we utilized React in its development

## Challenges

We encountered several challenges during our project. Initially, we attempted to integrate Google Translator to enable the page's translation from Russian, aiming to reach a broader customer base.
Unfortunately, the translation disappeared after refreshing or navigating to a new page. Despite extensive internet research, we couldn't find a solution to fix this issue. We experimented with relocating the function and script, but to no avail.
 we found a solution with google translate tag in HTML and we could design it to look like we wanted also we found a way in the web to make fewer option for translate.

Additionally, we faced difficulty creating separate components for the home: one for mobile view and another for computer and tablet displays. Initially, this seemed unsolvable, but our quest for answers led us to 'react-responsive.' This tool enabled us to utilize queries and 'useMedia' to identify the current view.

As a newly formed team with no prior collaborative experience, this project marked our maiden successful deployment. Despite the challenges, it's been a valuable learning experience for us.
